The n&rsquo;tal then leaves it&rsquo;s grove to gather as much information about the world as possible, so that one day it may return to it&rsquo;s home grove and enter it&rsquo;s next stage of life as a n&rsquo;tao; their bodies rotting away to serve as fertilizer for the seed that dwells within their brain.</p>\n<h2>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h2>\n<p>N'tal resemble small monkeys, with very short fuzzy fur (usually little more than an eighth of an inch) that ranges in color from snow white to pine green, and sometimes even more vibrant colors if they come from more tropical regions. Fibers inside their bodies serve as muscles and bones to help them move about with humanoids and within humanoid society, with two arms and two legs in the general shape of the creatures they mimic, as well as opposable thumbs, and a tail about half as long as their legs which serves as their stem as they ripen and becomes flexible once they mature. Their heads are slightly oval shaped and only serve as host for their eyes, since they lack a digestive system or sense of smell. Since they are fruit, their bodies are naturally full of glucose, which the n&rsquo;tal can burn for energy much as humanoids do (though they still must rest to allow their bodies to recharge). They also lack ears, but can perceive sound in the same way plant creatures do.</p>\n<h2>SOCIETY</h2>\n<p>N&rsquo;tao groves can grow virtually anywhere a tree can grow, and grow very rapidly over the course of several years worth of n&rsquo;tal returning to the grove to become n&rsquo;tao. The needles of n&rsquo;tao connect with others of their kind to form a lattice of pine needles that allows each n&rsquo;tao within the grove access to the thoughts and memories of it&rsquo;s fellows. It is incredibly common for powerful primal entities to live within these groves and protect them, knowing exactly how vast the depth of knowledge a n&rsquo;tao grove is, and since the n&rsquo;tao retain their life's experiences, it&rsquo;s not unheard of for magic to radiate out from a n&rsquo;tao grove as a means of dealing with threats.</p>\n<p>N&rsquo;tal are universally outside of their culture until they become n&rsquo;tao, and thus generally adopt the societal aspects of whatever societies they intermingle with, often resulting in a complex combination of many cultures, as the n&rsquo;tal are born with an innate curiosity and desire to learn. N&rsquo;tal are without gender, but are known to adopt the gender roles of societies around them, and may adopt multiple gender identities over the course of their lives.</p>\n<p>N&rsquo;tal may exist for up to 100 years, and n&rsquo;tao live for much longer, though the n&rsquo;tao believe they never truly die, they continue to exist as memory and emotion within the grove.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"source":{"value":"The N'tal Ancestry"},"traits":{"value":["hb_ntal","plant"],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.758,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-07-10T10:15:28.679-05:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.11.1.4"}}},"hp":8,"size":"sm","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["int"]},"1":{"value":["cha"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["dex"]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"N'tal"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["elven","gnomish","goblin","sylvan"],"custom":""},"items":{"rol6z":{"pack":"pf2e-ntal.ntal-feats","id":"Z7FKTNVhQDEYVYbq","img":"icons/consumables/nuts/pine-cone-red.webp","name":"N'tao Germination","level":0}},"vision":"darkvision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gKRAixZcnc2H4VRx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Dmx1amdpuokikDZt"}}}
